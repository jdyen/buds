## Functional data analysis of sprout-depth distributions

This repository contains code and data for an analysis of the distributions of sprout depths under an experimental clip-and-burn treatment. Code and data are supporting material for Vesk and Yen (submitted) How many sprouts and how deep? Flexible modelling of multi-species experimental disturbances.

### Using this code
The analyses presented here use the `greta` and `greta.fda` R packages. `greta` can be installed from CRAN or directly from GitHub using:
```
# from CRAN
install.packages("greta")

# from GitHub
devtools::install_github("greta-dev/greta")
```

The `greta.fda` package can be installed from GitHub:
```
devtools::install_github("jdyen/greta.fda")
```
