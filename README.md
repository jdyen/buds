## Functional data analysis of bud-depth distributions

This repository contains code and data for an analysis of the distributions of bud depths under an experimental clip-and-burn treatment. Code and data are supporting material for Vesk and Yen (in prep.) Plant resprouting: How many buds and how deep?

### Using this code
The analyses presented here use the `greta` and `greta.fda` R packages. `greta` can be installed from CRAN or directly from GitHub using:
```
# from CRAN
install.packages("greta")

# from GitHub
devtools::install_github("greta-dev/greta@dev")
```

The `greta.fda` package can be installed from GitHub:
```
devtools::install_github("jdyen/greta.fda")
```
